# So Simple that you want to use it !
I'm a huge fan of simple utilities but never got the courage to build them! I think this is the time where I overcome those write in public ðŸ™‚. As of know I'm I have two important projects in my mind!
1. Just Move It
2. OrgIt

## Just Movie It
It is a simple python script (may be with small UI as well!) which sends the notification or plays an alarm sound for every 40 min. Hey! I'm talking about thousands of developers(including me) who move barely If they sit for coding. These habits have the long term side effect. So I want self motivate myself to move from my chair! 

## OrgIt
Download folder cleaner. I download lots of different files
